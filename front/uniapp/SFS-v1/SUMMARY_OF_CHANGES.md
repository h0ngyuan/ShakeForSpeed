# Summary of Changes: Permission Handling Improvements

## Overview
We've made significant improvements to the permission handling in the ShakeForSpeed WeChat Mini Program, following best practices outlined in WeChat's documentation and industry references.

## Key Changes

### 1. User Information Permission Handling

**Before:**
- Used custom avatar selection and nickname input
- Requested permissions at app launch in `App.vue`
- Did not fully follow WeChat's recommended permission request pattern

**After:**
- Implemented WeChat's recommended button with `open-type="getUserInfo"`
- Added `onGetUserInfo` method to handle authorization callbacks properly
- Moved all user information permission logic to `pages/index/index.vue`
- Removed redundant permission handling from `App.vue`
- Added proper error handling when users deny permissions

### 2. Sensor Permission Handling

**Before:**
- Sensor permissions were requested without proper context
- No clear guidance for users when permissions were denied

**After:**
- Implemented `checkSensorPermission` and `requestSensorAuth` methods in `App.vue`
- Added `checkAndApplySensorPermission` in `index.vue` to request sensors only when needed
- Added clear UI guidance for users to manually enable permissions when denied
- Created a permission explanation popup to inform users about why permissions are needed

### 3. Documentation

- Created `PERMISSION_IMPLEMENTATION.md` to document the permission flow
- Added comments throughout the code to explain permission handling logic

## Implementation Details

### User Information Permission Flow
1. When the app starts, `index.vue` checks if the user is already authorized
2. If not authorized, a prominent authorization button is displayed
3. When the user taps the button, WeChat's native permission dialog appears
4. On authorization success, user information is stored and the game interface is displayed
5. On authorization failure, a toast message informs the user that authorization is required

### Sensor Permission Flow
1. When the game needs to access sensors, it calls `checkAndApplySensorPermission`
2. If permission is not granted, `App.vue`'s `requestSensorAuth` is called
3. If the user denies permission, a modal guides them to manual authorization in settings
4. Sensor data is only processed when the app is in the foreground and the game is active

## Next Steps
- Test the permission flow on real devices
- Implement location permission handling following the same pattern
- Add analytics to track permission acceptance rates
- Consider adding a custom settings page within the app for easier permission management

These changes improve user trust, compliance with WeChat's policies, and overall user experience<mcreference link="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/128858504" index="0">0</mcreference>.
